# NBA_webscrapper
This is an NBA Web Scrapper that scrapes the stats and information of NBA teams and players from the NBA.com website and saves them into csv and excel.

The web scraper was built using Spyder 4.1.4
The code should work by just clicking the run button.
If any issues arise check the NBA.com website and the links scraped by the scraper. Sometimes NBA.com will reroute a player's original link to another page with
almost similar content but since the page is built different the code won't work. Wait till NBA fixes the broken link and retry the code.
